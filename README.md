# Internet Identity Setup Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up Internet Identity for your application. Internet Identity is a decentralized authentication system for verifying users without using traditional usernames and passwords.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Internet Identity, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **dfx (Dfinity SDK)** installed. You can follow the instructions [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/dfx-installation).
- **An Identity Anchor**: This is required for Internet Identity. You can create one during the setup process.

## Steps to Set Up Internet Identity

### 1. Install the DFINITY Canister SDK

If you havenâ€™t installed the DFINITY SDK (`dfx`), install it by running the following commands:

```bash
###1. Install DFINITY SDK
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"


## 2.Create a New Project
Create a new project in which you will integrate Internet Identity:

```bash

###3. Add Internet Identity Canister
Modify the dfx.json file to add the Internet Identity canister to your project, allowing your project to interact with the Internet Identity system. Add the following configuration under "canisters":

```bash
{
  "canisters": {
    "internet_identity": {
      "type": "pull",
      "url": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity.git",
      "sha": "latest"
    }
  }
}
###4.Configure the dfx.json File
Ensure your dfx.json file includes the following configurations for deploying Internet Identity:
```bash
{
  "canisters": {
    "internet_identity": {
      "type": "pull",
      "url": "https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity.git",
      "sha": "latest"
    }
  },
  "networks": {
    "local": {
      "bind": "127.0.0.1:8000"
    }
  }
}
###5.Deploy the Internet Identity Canister
Deploy the Internet Identity canister locally by running the following command:
```bash

dfx deploy internet_identity --network local

###6.Update Your Frontend to Use Internet Identity
Add the following code to your frontend to authenticate users via Internet Identity. Ensure you have a working HTML/JavaScript frontend:
```bash
<button id="login">Login with Internet Identity</button>

<script>
  const authenticate = async () => {
    const identity = await window.ic?.identity?.get();
    console.log("Authenticated identity: ", identity);
  }

  document.getElementById("login").onclick = authenticate;
</script>
###7.Test Locally
To test the setup, start the local development server with the following command:
```bash
dfx start
###8.Deploy on Mainnet
Once everything works locally, deploy your canisters on the Internet Computer Mainnet by running:
```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
